    <h1>Midwestern Tornado Analysis with Highways</h1>
    <p>This R code loads and processes data on tornados and highways in the northern Midwest region of the USA using libraries such as <code>GISTools</code>, <code>sf</code>, <code>dplyr</code>, <code>terra</code>, <code>spData</code>, <code>tmap</code>, and <code>tigris</code>. It filters and subsets the data to focus on a specific set of states and time period. It also performs spatial operations such as transforming and clipping the data, buffering highways, and identifying tornados within the buffer zone. Finally, it visualizes the data using <code>qtm()</code> and <code>tm_*()</code> functions from the <code>tmap</code> library.</p>
